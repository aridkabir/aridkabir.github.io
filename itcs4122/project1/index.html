    <h1>What Factors Influence Second-Hand Car Prices the Most?</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        In this day and age, buying a used car is becoming increasingly expensive,
        especially compared to new cars. But why is this happening? What is driving
        the price of second-hand cars so much, especially compared to a decade ago?
        To explore this question, I analyzed a dataset of second-hand car listings
        from Kaggle to identify the most influential factors on used car prices.

      <h2>How Does the Year of Manufacture Impact Price?</h2>
      <p>
        This chart shows a clear relationship between the car's age and its price.
        As expected, newer cars command significantly higher prices, with the median
        price rising steadily from around £4,500 for cars made in 2000 to almost
        £49,000 for models in 2025. This trend reflects buyer preferences for newer
        vehicles due to improved safety features, modern conveniences, and a lower
        risk of mechanical failure. Sellers can price newer cars higher because
        demand is stronger, while older vehicles naturally depreciate in value.

      <h2>How Do Different Brands Affect Price?</h2>
      <p>
        The brand of a car plays a major role in its resale value. Luxury brands like
        Porsche and BMW generally maintain higher prices, showing a wide range of
        listings that reflect different models and conditions. Mainstream brands
        such as Ford and Toyota typically have lower median prices but offer more
        affordable options for budget-conscious buyers. Understanding brand-specific
        pricing helps buyers align their choices with their budget and expectations,
        while sellers can set competitive prices based on brand reputation and demand.

      <h2>What Role Does Mileage Play in Pricing?</h2>
      <p>
        Mileage is a crucial factor in determining a used car’s price. This chart
        illustrates that cars with fewer miles tend to have higher median prices,
        with a noticeable drop-off after 100,000 miles. This makes sense, as higher
        mileage typically indicates more wear and tear, and increases the likelihood
        of costly repairs. Buyers who prioritize longevity and reliability may prefer
        lower mileage cars even if they cost more upfront.

      <h2>Which Brands Dominate the Market?</h2>
      <p>
        Finally, looking at the number of listings per brand provides insight into
        market availability. Ford and Toyota dominate the UK second-hand market with
        the highest quantities of cars listed, offering buyers a wide selection.
        These brands' popularity may be due to factors like affordability, reliability,
        and brand loyalty. Meanwhile, luxury brands have fewer listings, which can
        affect their prices due to supply scarcity.

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion: Why These Insights Matter</h2>
      <p>
        For buyers, this analysis highlights how key factors like age, mileage, and brand
        influence price, enabling more informed decisions based on personal needs and
        budget. Some buyers may prioritize affordability and choose high-mileage Toyotas,
        while others might seek luxury and newer models despite the higher cost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sellers, on the other hand, can use these trends to better price their vehicles
        and anticipate market demand. Knowing how much value is retained over time, or
        how mileage impacts price, can help maximize resale value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding these dynamics contributes to a healthier, more transparent used
        car market—benefiting both buyers and sellers.

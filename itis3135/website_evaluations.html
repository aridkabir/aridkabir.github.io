                <section class="website1">
                    <a href="https://apple.com"><h3>Apple</h3></a>
                    <p>Apple is one of the largest tech companies in the world, producing products such as iPhone, iPad, Mac, and many more. They are very design oriented, believing that the user experience is centered around good design.</p>
                    <section class="list">
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Contrast: </b> Apple uses a white background for their page, and black text which instantly creates a good contrast. The thing about Apple's website is that it doesn't look unintentional, but rather part of the design.</li>
                            <li><b>Repetition:</b> Apple uses a standarized font family and UI design to deliver a clean and coherent user experience on their website. </li>
                            <li><b>Alignment:</b> Apple's website has a very minimalist design in terms of alignment, having clear and uniform margins with each section.</li>
                            <li><b>Proximity: </b>Apple utilizes proximity well, giving plenty of space between each section, making sure they are properly showcased.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Overall, Apple does a great job at minimalist design, further strengthening their brand and recognition.</p>

                    <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html"><h3>The first website ever made</h3></a>
                    <p>While the World Wide Web was first created in 1989, the first website was created on August 6th, 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee while working at CERN, hosted on a NeXT computer. Being the first of it's kind, it uses basic HTML.</p>
                    <section class="list">
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Contrast: </b> While this site has the same color scheme as Apple's, it is much more primitive, and doesn't seem to be by choice. This makes the website seem bland.</li>
                            <li><b>Repetition:</b> The website does retain a old school look, giving it a clear brand image. However, there is only one H1, and the rest is just paragraph text, making the clarity diffcult to discern.</li>
                            <li><b>Alignment:</b> There is no proper margins or alignment in this website, all aligned to the left.</li>
                            <li><b>Proximity: </b>This website uses no spacing to create a diversion of attention or emphasis of certain topics.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>
                    <p>Overall, this website does not follow CRAP design philosophy well, but we can forgive it as this website is a pioneer and a first of it's kind.</p>
